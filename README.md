# Love & Guns

This is a small Löve2D game project, originaly made for a one hour event. It's a basic top view shooter made of only primitives. Feel free to criticize, fork or whatsoever.

## How to use

You're going to need a Löve2D executable : [Löve2D](http://www.love2d.org "Löve2D"). One you've cloned the repo, you have two choices :

1.	Zip all the files and rename the .zip extension in .love. Make sure main.lua file in at archive root and not in a child folder
2.	leave files in a standalone folder

Depending on which solution you chose, you can run game through this command

	love archive.love

or

	love folder/
